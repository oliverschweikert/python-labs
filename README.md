# Python Labs

## Summary
Check out the pdf's in the docs folder for the instructions given for each lab.
Labset 1 is building a terminal shopping list application
Labset 2 is building a terminal telephone contact storage application

For both labsets, labs 1-9 are for building the functions that will be used in the final application, while lab 10 is the final application that brings all the other labs together.

Each lab also has test functions that are equivalent to the tests supplied in the pdf's. Just uncomment the test you would like to run, and enter the appropriate input if necessary, and then compare with the output in the pdf.

## Todo
1. Add comments explaining the difficult parts of the code
